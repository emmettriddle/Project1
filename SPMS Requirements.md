# Project 1 Requirements
> # Story Pitch Management System
- # Authors can submit story pitches
    - Different types of work have different weights
        - ***Maximum point total of 100***
        - Novels: 50 points
        - Novellas: 25 points
        - short stories: 20 points
        - articles: 10 points
    - If an author attempts to submit a story that they do not have sufficient points for, the submission is put on hold until enough points are available.
    
    ### **Story Pitch Form**
    - Must include the following information:
        - basic information about the author
        - tentative story title
        - tentative completion date
        - story type (based on length, **chosen by the system?**)
        - genre
        - tag line
        - detailed description
    - Optional inclusions:
        - attachments regarding any research or images related to the story
        - any .msg (Outlook Email) files that feature any discussion with any of our agents or external sources (especially in the case of non-fiction, research-based works)
    - Form should have a field that calculates whether the author currently has sufficient points to submit the request, or if it will be saved for later submission (as described above)

    ### **Business Rules**
    - Story types and genres each pulled from reference tables.
        - Story type reflects number of points author will have availabe whilst the story is pending.
        - Story type also determines the approval process (see below)
        - Genre determines whom the story will be managed by.
        - Each genre has a group of editors with specialization in that genre.
- # Approval Process
    - ## Assistant Editor Approval
        - An assistant in the relevant genre committee must approve the story pitch.
        - The assistant can request more informaiton from the author before approving the pitch, if desired.
        - If the request is denied, a reason must be provided to the author.
        - If the assistant takes too much time to approve the pitch, it is marked as **high priority** and must be processed before other pending requests.
        - If the relevant genre committee does not have an Assistant Editor, this step is skipped.
    - ## General Editor Approval
        - After approval from the Assistant Editor, an editor who is **NOT** in the relevant genre committee must then approve the request.
        - This editor can request more information from either the author or the Assistant Editor that approved the pitch, if desired.
        - If denied, a reason must be provided to the author.
        - If the editor takes too much time, the request is marked as **high priority** and must be processed before other pending requests.
    - ## Senior Editor Approval
        - A senior editor from the relevant genre committee must then approve the request.
        - This editor can request more information from the author, as well as information from any other editors that have approved the request, if desired.
        - This editor also has the ability to change the tentative title, tag line, or completion date.
            - If any of this information is changed, the author should be notified, and should have an opportunity to approve the changes or cancel the request.
        - If the editor takes too much time, the request should be marked as **high priority** and should be shown at the top of the list of pending requests, but this should not prevent other requests from being processed.
- # Completed Story Upload
    - Once the author's request has been approved, a completed draft of the story must be submitted for proofreading.
        - Depending on story type (length), the draft must be proofread and approved by a variable number of individuals.
        - Proofreaders can request that changes be made to the draft.
        - If changes are requested, the author should be notified, and the pitch will remain pending until an updated draft is submitted.
    - ## Proofreaders Based on Story Type (length)
        - **Articles:** Draft only needs approval from the Senior Editor
        - **Short Stories:** Draft must be approved by the Senior Editor, as well as one other editor from the relative genre committee.
        - **Novellas and Novels:** Draft must be approved by a majority of editors in the genre committee.
    - Drafts should only be viewable by the author and editors within the relevant genre committee, as well as the editor that is not in the committee that approved the pitch.
- # Miscellaneous
    - Editors can be in multiple genre committees.
    - A genre committee should have at least 3 editors and at least 1 senior editor, with a maximum of 2 senior editors per committee.
